### Step 1: Install Poetry

If Poetry is not already installed, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install poetry
```

For more installation options, visit the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Step 2: Install Python 3.11

We use the deadsnakes PPA to install Python 3.11 on Ubuntu. Follow these commands:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev
```

### Step 3: Configure Poetry to Use Python 3.11

Ensure you're in your project directory, then run:

```sh
poetry env use python3.11
```

### Step 4: Install Project Dependencies

Install the necessary project dependencies by running:

```sh
poetry install
```

### Step 5: Activate the Poetry-Managed Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment managed by Poetry:

```sh
poetry shell
```

  ### Linting and Formatting

  To ensure code consistency and quality, we recommend using linting and formatting tools.

  - **Black**: Black is a code formatter that automatically formats Python code to adhere to the PEP 8 style guide.
    ```sh
    poetry run black .
    ```

  - **flake8**: flake8 is a Python linter that checks your code against coding standards and identifies potential errors or style issues.
    ```sh
    poetry run flake8 .
    ```

  Run these commands in your terminal within the project directory to lint and format your code.
